Along with this site's [menu](#nav-menu), you can also browse by the
 following sections:

 - [Tags](/tags/)
 - [Categories](/categories/)

An [RSS feed](/index.xml) is available by default.

A [search engine friendly sitemap](/sitemap.xml) can be submitted to search
 engines or other tools to more easily index your site.

A [robots.txt file](/robots.txt) helps inform search engines and other tools
 where to find your sitemap and to explicitly tell them you want your site's
 content to be indexed.
