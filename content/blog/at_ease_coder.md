This is the mysterious moment. The end of a productive day. I should feel elated at the deluge de jour after such a dry season. But, I know better. I've had good days in the past. Sometimes continuing for months. Recently though, my productive moments are but exciting palpitations between long flat lines on the machine that goes *ping*.

What led to this fruitful day of coding, exercise and general GSDiness?

We may look for answers in the alternative state of depression, where consecutive failures of any size can snowball into the *learned helplessness* feeling that regardless of what we try, we won't succeed. I haven't been consciously feeling that self-pity in my unproductive days, preferring just as uselessly stare into space or sit and relax. But, the result is the same, I don't choose to do anything towards bettering my situation, merely enough to survive.
