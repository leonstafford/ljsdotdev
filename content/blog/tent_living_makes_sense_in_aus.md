Broke and living in a tent as a software developer. Wow, 2020 has really taken its toll! I jest. This was an eventuation soley of my making. The tent living was very purposeful, the being broke less so, but not a shock to anyone who's known my financial prowess of the last 20 years.

In finishing up my rental unit's contract in Port Lincoln last month, Iwas preparing to setoff as a fulltime bikepacker, going so far as to buy and kit out a beach cruiser bike. As departure day loomed nearer, I remembered the traumatic 70km ride I did with Andy somewhere in the middle of China some years back. And of how I quickly sold that bike in exchange for a lift in some rural guy's truck, nursing my aching perineum (the fault of the saddle fit and my inexperience, not Andy's!). I'd already sold our '94 Ford Laser to force me into the bikepacking, so instead looked to simply living out of a backpack.

Inline with my penchant for tech minimalism and [tendency towards extremes](/blog/true_cost/), I'd spent my last dollars on some magic beans and ultralight camping gear, stripping things down to the bare essentials, then getting rid of half of those, too. The pack I set off with, including my chopped in half toothbrush to shave grams, weighed about 7 or 8kgs. That's about what I lived through 2021 with in my backpack, but that was a much easier feat, globetrotting in hotels for the year. This time, I'd hit the same weight, including my snail shell itself and everything that was to keep me from the elements and, more importantly, insects.
