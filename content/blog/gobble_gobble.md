Mmm, is this organic?  
Mmm, is this organic?  
Jinx!  
Us newly divided cells gotta eat,  
Gotta reproduce, mate.  
Time to split.  

Wait, you look different!  
A freak! Must be weak!  

Butter lass, I'm strong! I belong!  
Mutants like me let us carry-on!  

Ooh, that's nice!  
That's different, unusual.  
Quinoa pancakes you say?  
Your place or mine?  

Your room is a mess,  
You don't listen to us anymore!  
We just want to love you,  
By forcing you into a mold of us.  

I'm different, not my fault!  
Maybe I'm programmed this way.
